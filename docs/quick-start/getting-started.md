# Getting Started

Prerequisites
 * You have a Bash shell.
 * You have Git installed.
 * You have Docker installed.

There are three quick start options available:

* On MAC OSX using Homebrew :
```bash
$ brew tap athena-oss/athena
$ brew install athena
```
* [Download the latest release](https://github.com/athena-oss/athena/releases/latest)
* Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/athena-oss/athena.git`

Now that you have Athena you can explore the Examples section.

If you want to start by building your own plugin use the wizard :

```bash
$ ./athena wizard start [<name_of_the_plugin>]
```

You can also install plugins by using the following command :

```bash
$ ./athena plugins install <name> <repo>
```
